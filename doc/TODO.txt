### SOON ###
    investigate why PreprocessorTest is failing

    find all usages of getName and check for nullability problems

    reimplement c file writers
        create c entities instead and then write them using library

    rewrite constant translation
        ideally all values should be loaded from c code
        type recognition will still be in place to find out the correct data type

    for all services, use proper synchronization in getInstance

### LATER ###
    remove to do in VulkanTransformator when no longer needed

    fix error during compilation of native code of xlib configuration
        Display.c:11:50: error: invalid application of ‘sizeof’ to incomplete type ‘Display’ {aka ‘struct _XDisplay’}
