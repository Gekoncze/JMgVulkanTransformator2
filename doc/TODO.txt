### NOW ###
    fix error:
        Could not find parser for VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_2_NONE of type CVariable.
            looks like this is caused by new implementation of flags enums using global constants
            possible solution might be to pair them by variable type and const modifier + detect typedef of flags

### SOON ###
    reimplement c file writers
        create c entities instead and then write them using library
            how to handle directives ?
                this might require directives to be c entities and c file to contain c entities
                    c main entity might be removed then, or replaced by named interface
            how to handle c function implementation ?
            how to handle special attributes ?

    rewrite constant translation
        ideally all values should be loaded from c code
        type recognition will still be in place to find out the correct data type


### LATER ###
    for all services, use proper synchronization in getInstance

    remove to do in VulkanTransformator when no longer needed

    fix error during compilation of native code of xlib configuration
        Display.c:11:50: error: invalid application of ‘sizeof’ to incomplete type ‘Display’ {aka ‘struct _XDisplay’}
